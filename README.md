# Operation Automate
A bold project to develop an internal, security reporting application with export capabilities, scheduling integration and automated review for use within the firm and external corporate entities. Development will focus on creating a Proof-of-Concept, demonstrating a User Interface (UI), issue library, template upload and export to .docx format. Successfully delivering this tool will promote our Cyber Strategy 2.0, allowing for justification of funding for future development.

# Goal


# Phase 1
Create a basic, functional application consisting of an issue library, user roles, project creation and population of a template, with the ability to export in word format. It should be possible to demonstrate the login process, creating a report for a specified engagement/client, assigning resources, editing the online report and exporting the report to populate a pre-defined template.

# Phase 2
Front-End Development. Add additional functionality such as multiple clients, multiple projects, access controls for projects and user roles, multiple templates. This phase should showcase a beta version of a functional, industry standard reporting tool.

# Phase 3
Development of UX/UI should now be complete. Application functionality has been completed as has API development. 

# Phase 4
Management and modification of team schedule.
1) Have information about each project
2) enable the assignment of projects to each part
3) reflect the current status of projects - including integration with reporting tool via API (i.e. does client exist, does project exist)
4) provide an overview of teams schedule
5) include analytics + predictions. For example:
Suggest time that projects can be scheduled
forecast potential gaps
provide a live counter on team availability
6) Integrate with eTime to both:
Update schedule based on eTime schedule (i.e. pull from eTime) - do this on a nightly basis and highlight any inconsistencies before applying to schedule.
Provide updates to scheduling based on our schedule changes - potentially look at integrating directly with eTime admin.

# Phase 5
Automated
